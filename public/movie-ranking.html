<h1>The Best Movies According to Nikhil</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>This movie is about three students who joined a pioneer engineering college of India and their journey of struggle through daily lives, competetiveness and finding themselves through it.</p>

<h3>The Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>A finest piece of storyline concluding with all the different superheroes of MCU come together to save Earth from Thanos.</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
<p>The final movie of Dark Night triology and final movie of Christian Bale as Batman. <br />
The movie shows how after having everything in life now the batman has nothing and is down broken in a prison underground. It shows the journey of Batman from learning how to walk to defeating the most dangerous enemy he ever faced.
